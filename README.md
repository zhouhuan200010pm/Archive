Hello I am Jiacheng Zhou, you can also call me Dixon!
Here is my Program for the Archive Project, I will list all the things that needed for this program to run!
The links above are the links for my videos, I am sorry that I am a little intense so that the order that I talk may be a little confuse.

Before the prorgam runs, we need:
1. **Python** Enviornment with **pip** installed as the script
2. A Gmail account with 'imap' service enabled, it can be changed at the gmail website in the setting section which is about "pop/imap". I also talked about how to set this up at the end of the first video.
3. Enable the less secure app permission, which can be found here in this page: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
4. Remember to check if you really enabled them, they are necessary for this program to run

With all these set, we are ready to run! To run:
1. Click on the **Start.bat** to start the program, if this is the first time you run it, it may take some time as it will install a lot of packages
2. Wait until it pops out a line that ask you for your Gmail address, then you will enter your address first and enter your password in the next line
3. If this is the first time you use this program, then you need to provide the permission for this program to edit your google calendar. So it will pops out a website and you need to click on your google account.
4. You will see a page with it says this app is insecure, what you need to do is go to the advance at the bottom left and click on go to Quickstart
5. It will ask for the permission, just click allow for all of them, and after that, everything is done!
6. If you recieved "All Done! Press 'Enter' to quit!", then the program is finished! Go check your calendar to see if there is such event!

Other message:
1. We need the Email from the library to create the event, so it will only run with the specific input from the library with the title "library checkout receipt"
2. If you recieved a problem where it doesn't have "All Done! Press 'Enter' to quit!" as the program finish but the terminal just close itself, then you should check if any step goes wrong, you can always delete the '.pickle' file to request the permission again. The Problems can be: (You can check the first one and then go down one by one)
    - Wrong Password
    - Didn't enable the 'imap' service and the less secure app permission
    - Lack of the enviornment needed
3. After the first time you run the program, it will save the username and it will not ask for permission again
4. This app is safe, it just didn't verified through google
5. The password is hidden when you type it in the terminal, don't worry if you didn't see them
6. Becareful when adding an event in the past, because the program can put multiple same event into the calendar whenever you run the program again

I wish you have a great time using this program!
